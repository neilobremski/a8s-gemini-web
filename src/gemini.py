"""Everything that knows what Gemini's web interface looks like.

**This is the file that breaks when Google changes the interface.** That is not
a defect in this driver, it is the standing cost of driving a web app that
publishes no API, and patching this module is expected maintenance rather than
a bug report. Every selector, label, heading and URL shape the program relies
on is here, so a break is one file to read and one file to fix.
`docs/gemini-ui.md` lists each one and how to re-derive it from a snapshot.

Two sources, both named in that doc:

*Observed on the live interface, 2026-09-23, through `a8s-browser snap`* — the
prompt box's name, that a new chat has no id until the first message is sent,
the `You said` / `Gemini said` headings that separate the turns, the button
cluster that marks a finished reply, and the mode picker's name. On 2026-09-24:
the upload menu and its chip, a generated image and its download control. The
interface changes without notice, so these are current readings and not
constants.

*From b3t* (`apps/b3t/gemini.py` in `neilobremski/bin`, which drives Gemini Web
through playwright-cli today) — the app URL, the sign-in check, finding the
prompt box as the snapshot's `textbox`, sending with fill-then-Enter, and
polling snapshots for a completion signal rather than guessing a wait. b3t
needs the same fixes whenever this module does.

Unverified and best effort: naming a conversation after its correspondent, and
selecting a model. Both are non-fatal by design — a turn that cannot rename or
cannot switch models still delivers its reply.

    a model failure, and it costs a turn to discover.

    Confirmation is two things, and "the filename is on the page" is neither.

    **The name has to be new.** The snapshot is the whole page, conversation
    included, so a name mentioned in an earlier turn would confirm an upload
    that has not begun. What is required is one *more* occurrence than a
    baseline taken before the upload — a count, not a presence, so sending the
    same filename twice still works.

    **The composer has to say it will send.** A filename renders while the
    upload is still running, and a page that has stopped changing is not proof
    of anything: a paused progress bar and a disabled button are textually
    identical from one poll to the next. `Send message` is the page's own answer
    to "will you send this now", and it is positive evidence rather than the
    absence of a marker this driver has never been shown.
