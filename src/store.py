"""One Gemini conversation per correspondent, remembered across restarts.

A correspondent who gets a new conversation every message gets an agent with no
memory of the last thing it said, which is the whole value of a chat. The store
is the map from a sender to the conversation URL that belongs to them.

It is small, it is JSON, and it is written whole: a turn either records the new
conversation or it does not. A store that cannot be read is treated as empty
and said out loud in the reply, because a wake that dies on its own bookkeeping
loses the message it was woken for.

**Every mutation reloads under an exclusive lock.** An atomic replace makes each
write whole, which is not the same as making two writers safe: without the lock
two runs both read the same map, each add their own correspondent, and the
second replace erases the first one's conversation. That sender then gets a new
chat with no memory, which is the exact failure this file exists to prevent.
