"""Replies that were produced but not delivered.

A turn spends a real conversation with Gemini. If `tell` then fails — the
router down, the broker unreachable — the answer exists and nobody has it, and
re-running the turn to get it again would ask Gemini the same question twice.
So a reply that cannot be handed over is written here, and the next run of this
seat delivers it before it does anything else.

A reply's attachments are *copied* here beside it, not referenced. The files a
turn produces are browser-seat artifacts, and that directory is swept; a queue
holding a path into it would deliver an answer that names a file nobody has,
which is worse than not delivering at all.

One file per reply, named so they sort oldest first, each written atomically.
Two things keep a reply from going out twice:

- **One flusher at a time.** `flush` holds an exclusive lock for its whole run.
  A second run finds it taken and leaves the queue alone rather than racing it.
- **A claim carries its own age.** Inside the lock, a reply is renamed before
  it is sent, and the claim's *name* records when it was taken. A rename keeps
  the file's mtime, so an mtime-based expiry would call the brand-new claim on
  an hour-old reply already stale — and a second run would deliver it again
  while the first send was still in flight. The name is written by the rename
  itself, so there is no window in which a live claim looks abandoned.

Recovery is what the age is for: a run that dies mid-send drops its lock with
it, and the next run puts its claim back once the claim is old enough that
nothing can still be sending it.
